# title-bot

## Project setup
```
npm install
npm start
```
Sometimes npm start will require changes to security settings to
access terminal.

An alernative way to open the project is by opening two terminals.
In one terminal run the command

```
npm run start-backend
```

This will start the express app which is used in the backend.

Then in another terminal window, run the command
```
npm run serve
```
This will start the vue server.

Finally navigate to localhost:8080 to access the frontend.
